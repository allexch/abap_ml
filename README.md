# abap_ml
Classes and functionality to reproduce basic Machine Learning stuff in ABAP. Starting from vector/matrix API

- operations with float vector/matrix  (zcl_matrix, zcl_vector)
- linear regression (zcl_regression)
- logistic regression ( beta version available )
- stochastic gradient descend  (zcl_sgd)
- also I'll try to implement simple neural net  ( ..in progress .. )

- class for maintaining dynamic dataset, that supports feature engineering like python pandas DataFrame (in progress)

All will be available here, and can be installed by copy/paste and maybe some renaming.

Example of matrix/vector operations, linear/log regression and sgd-optimizations: in folder "examples"
